# TP-Craze
This is a web-based app designed to help consumers stay up to date on inventory levels of essential goods such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer at nearby stores amidst the current Covid-19 pandemic. TP Craze first gathers data on current stock, crowdsourced from both customers and verified store managers. Then, by simply entering your location and desired search radius, TP Craze lists all applicable stores and their current stock levels. TP Craze is accessible by visiting westfordcodevid123.pythonanywhere.com. 

Matthew Ding, Jason Liang, Ethan Mendes, David Towers, and Jerry Xu worked on this project, which was submitted to the Codevid-19 Hackathon.
